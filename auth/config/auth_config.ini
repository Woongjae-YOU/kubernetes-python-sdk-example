# AUTH_TYPE indicates how SDK conducts authentication to Kubnernetes.

# AUTH_TYPE = 1 : Authentication using secret mounted inside a pod
# It don't need any information for access

# AUTH_TYPE = 2 : Access to kube-apiserver using token of ServiceAccount (HTTP bearer)
# You have to specify base64 encoded token and kube-apiserver endpoint address.

# AUTH_TYPE = 3 : Authentication using certificate (Common Name: CN or Organization : O)
# You have to specify the certificate file name (public certificate and private key signed by Kubernetes root CA)
# Also, a User set within CN should have proper role or clusterrole to access all resources.
